üèóÔ∏è Assembly
============================

Assembly 
----------
Due to the high amount of components integrated in such small PCB layout, most of them are too small to be soldered at home by you. Therefore, these boards come already 
with the components assembled. 

The |Product|, in addition to the PCB assembled board, consist on the following parts:

- A 2.9" e-paper display. The recommended (and tested working) e-ink panel is the `296x128, 2.9inch E-Ink raw display panel <https://www.waveshare.com/product/2.9inch-e-paper.htm>`_ that you can order directly on the manufacturer. 
  Please note that **other displays may not work at all**.
- A :term:`LiPo` battery, with a recommended 1000mAh capacity, for space and power. The ideal dimensions shouldn't excess the 50x34x5mm in order to fit in the designed enclosure.
- An enclosure where to fit the |Product| upper part that you can find on the :ref:`enclosure` section.
- Optionally, you can mount a solar panel that charges the battery under the right sunny conditions. The output voltage of the panel musn't excess the 6V and the recommended size to fit in the designed enclosure is 80x45mm
