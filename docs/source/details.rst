Power
--------
The |Product| is be powered through a :term:`LiPo` battery plugged into the white JST connector. The voltage of the battery is regulated to the working 3.3V through a low-consumption :term:`LDO`.

.. Caution::
    Connect the battery after clamping the e-paper connector and be careful when plugging it or removing it, since the connector can be hard to plug/unplug.

In order to charge the battery, there is a battery management IC that provides the right charging curve to the :term:`LiPo` battery and offers a visual indicator (red LED for charging, 
green LED for standby) while the battery is being charged. There are two ways of charging the |Product|: USB-C or solar panel.

Solar panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: images/getting_started/Solar_soldering.png
    :align: right
    :figwidth: 200px
    
In addition to the USB-C, and with the aim of extending the service time between (USB) charges of the battery, the |Product| can be configured to be powered from a solar panel. This feature 
would imply soldering the solar pannel to the board as indicated in the figure.

USB-C
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The USB Type-C is a very extended port for portable electronics, and because of it's standarized 5V power supply is ideal for charging the |Product|.


Sensors
--------   
As the |Product| is intended to work during long periods of time without having to be recharged, it is important to avoid undesired consumptions 
durint the deep-sleep periods. This implies that the sensors have to be powered **only** when they are needed. 

Therefore there is a high-switch circuit that enables/disables the powering of the *sensors power line* connected to the microcontroller's output **GPIO4**.

Regarding the sensors, and except for the soil moisture sensor which is analog, the rest (illuminance, temperature & humidity, battery status) are :term:`IIC` (:math:`I^2C`) sensors,
which are physically defined with the following pinout:

:SDA: **GPIO33**
:SCL: **GPIO34**

Soil moisture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: images/getting_started/soil_moisture.png
    :align: left
    :figwidth: 50px
    
Since the |Product| can be directly inserted into the soil of your pot, the area inserted contains a printed circuit that behaves as a 
probe that measures the soil capacity, determined by the soil moisture. As it has no metallic electrodes, there is no risk of probe degradation 
with time. 

The moisture level, in a 0-3.3V range, is measured through the ADC on **GPIO1**

|
|

Light sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The illuminance is measured through a digital sensor VEML7700-TR. This sensor is located facing the outside of the top part of the board, so it 
would be facing the sky. 

The VEML7700 is quite a convenient sensor since it delivers the values directly in lux. 
The sensor has 16-bit dynamic range for ambient light detection from 0 lux to about 120k lux with resolution down to 0.0036 lx/ct, 
with software-adjustable gain and integration times.

The :math:`I^2C` address is **0x10**.

.. Hint::
    If you are designing your own enclosure, make sure there is a hole for the light sensor on the case.

Ambient temperature & humidity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: images/getting_started/aht20.png
    :align: left
    :figwidth: 100px
The |Product| embeds an AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor ready to deliver calibrated data through the :math:`I^2C` bus.

This sensor has an operational relative humidity range of 0 to 100% ( with a ±3 % typical accuracy), and a temperature range of -40 to 85 °C (±1 °C typical accuracy)

The :math:`I^2C` address is **0x38**.

Battery level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For measuring the battery level, the |Product| integrates the MAX17048 :term:`IC`.

This sensor measures the voltage of the LiPo cell and does the math to get an estimative percentage of the battery level.

The :math:`I^2C` address is **0x36**.

E-paper
--------
    
The e-ink display pinout with respect to the ESP32 GPIOs goes as follows:

Enclosure
---------
The |Product| PCB can be mounted in a custom :ref:`enclosure` that you can print on your own 3D printer.
