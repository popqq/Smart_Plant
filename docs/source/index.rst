Welcome to the documentation page of the |Product|, a device to monitor the environmental conditions of your favourite plant.

With the |Product| you can measure a range of paramaters such as the soil moisture, ambient light and the air temperature & relative humidity. 
In adition to the IoT capabilities of streaming the measured parameters into your favourite platform, like Home Assistant, you can read the data directly on 
the integrated 2.9" e-paper display.

As you can imagine, all this features would be useless if the design is not optimized to consume the lowest energy possible: thanks to the deep-sleep features of 
the ESP32 microcontroller, a selection of low-consumption electronics (high-efficient LDOs in standby modes, power-switched sensors and partially refreshed e-paper) 
and the optional solar cell. 

Everything packed in a quite compact but elegant device that can be directly plugged into your plant's pot.
